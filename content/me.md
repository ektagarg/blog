I am a Software Development Engineer currently working at Grofers, India. I love solving problems, curious about "how" [in science, space, and technology], writing about my technical findings, giving tech talks.

I have started this blog on 31st Dec 2020 with the aim to keep posting about interesting problems I solve, tech topics I read about, TIL, etc. I will try my best to keep my contributions.

I will be mostly writing about these key areas in my upcoming blogs:
1. Programming (Go, Python)
2. Networking
3. Optimization
4. Low-level design
5. High-level design
