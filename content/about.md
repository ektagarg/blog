I am a Software Development Engineer currently working at Grofers, India. 
I love solving problems, curious about "how" [in science, space and technology], writing about my technical findings, giving tech talks.

I have started this blog on 31st Dec, 2020 with the aim to keep posting about interesting problems I solve, tech topics I read about, TIL etc. I will try my best to keep my contributions.

There are some key areas, I will be focusing about in my upcoming blogs:
1. Programming (Go, Python)
2. Networking
3. Optimisation
4. Low level design
5. High level design
