This year has been a roller coaster ride for me, and I guess, for most people. Things were so uncertain. Even during this time of uncertainty, some of the tech communities have gone completely online and done a tremendous job of organizing conferences. This blog is about all the talks I gave at various conferences this year and all of them are related to [Go](https://golang.org/).

## Go
One of the great things which I feel [Go](https://golang.org/) offers is __clarity__ and __ease-of-use__. I have started working in Go around a year and a half back and I am still exploring a lot of its features. 
> Go is a general-purpose programming language. Write whatever you want in it and don't worry about pinning the language, or any other technology for that matter, to a single problem domain. <cite> ~Rob Pike</cite>

## Gophercon EU Lightning Talk
After attending a handful of conferences earlier this year, I applied for a lightning talk at __Gophercon EU__. My talk proposal got accepted and it was both nervous and exciting at the same time, as this was going to be my first talk at any conference.

#### About the topic:

I have been exploring web assembly for quite some time. I created a simple project in __GO using WASM__ where I used [image library](https://golang.org/pkg/image/) of Go and used its filter functions and wrote a program to apply filters on any image and then loaded it into the browser using WASM. So my talk was around this topic only "Running Go in browsers using WASM".

And, It was time to review my own talk. There are so many things which I got to learn about presenting a talk, time management, live coding, demo, etc.

I want to thank [Natalie](https://twitter.com/NataliePis), [Paula](https://twitter.com/pbabbicola) ,and the entire [Gophercon EU](https://twitter.com/gopherconeu) team for organizing, giving me an opportunity to talk, and they have been super supportive the whole time.

## Gophercon Turkey Talk
In Gophercon lightning talk, I couldn't present the whole topic and things I wanted to cover as it was a small 7-min talk. So I applied at Gophercon Turkey for a talk and my proposal at Gophercon Turkey got accepted.

This time, I was able to cover the topic entirely in this talk, I did a little code walkthrough followed up with the demo.

Great feeling when someone finds it useful:

A big thanks to [Gophercon Turkey](https://twitter.com/GoTurkiye) for organizing the conference and giving me the opportunity to present what I wanted to.

## Women-Who-GO Delhi chapter
This is a local GO community, where they organize meetups and encourage people to talk/listen/learn about Golang. Here I gave two talks:
* one was about using the REST framework (GIN) in Golang.
* Another talk was about Testing in Golang.

These talks were very beginner centric talks.

I would like to thank [Rashmi Nagpal](https://twitter.com/iamrashminagpal) for organizing these meetups and encouraging people in speaking and attending talks.

### Conclusion

Be part of tech communities, open-source, learn, explore as much as you can. If you are a newbie or an experienced in Go, I would encourage you to join this [slack channel](gophers.slack.com).

Goodbye 2020! You've treated me fine.
