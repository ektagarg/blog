      <description>What is a CDN? It is a service that accelerates internet content delivery to make your website faster.

      <description>This year has been a roller coaster ride for me, and I guess, for most people. Things were so uncertain.

This blog is about all the talks I gave at various conferences this year and all of them are related to Go.
Go One of the great things which I feel Go offers is clarity and ease-of-use.</description>
